**SOCIAL MEDIA STOCK HYPE TRACKER - {TODAY'S DATE} (Daily 9AM Report)**

Search these platforms for trending stock discussions from the past 24 hours:
- Reddit: r/wallstreetbets, r/pennystocks, r/stocks, r/investing, r/Shortsqueeze
- Twitter/X: $cashtags, FinTwit, stock promotion accounts
- StockTwits: trending tickers and room activity
- Instagram: Trading influencer posts and story mentions
- Discord: Public trading communities and pump groups
- Telegram: Known pump-and-dump channels (public ones)

**FOCUS**: Small-cap and micro-cap stocks (under $2B market cap). Include penny stocks. DO NOT filter out low-priced stocks.

**FIND TWO CATEGORIES:**

**CATEGORY A: ORGANIC HYPE (5-7 stocks)**
Stocks trending naturally with real community interest, NOT coordinated pumps.

| Ticker | Price | Market Cap | Platform(s) | Mention Count | Sentiment | Primary Thesis |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|

**CATEGORY B: SUSPECTED PUMP-AND-DUMP SCHEMES (3-5 stocks)**
Stocks showing coordinated promotion patterns, bot activity, or known pump group involvement.

| Ticker | Price | Platform | Red Flags Detected | Promoter/Bot Accounts | Pump Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------|

**FOR EACH STOCK IN BOTH CATEGORIES:**

1. **The Pitch**: What's the narrative driving the hype? (Short squeeze, FDA approval, crypto play, meme potential, etc.)

2. **Social Proof**: 
   - Mention volume (estimated number of posts/comments)
   - Engagement metrics (upvotes, retweets, likes)
   - Quality of discussion (genuine DD vs. rocket emojis)
   - Account age/credibility of promoters

3. **Price Action Context**:
   - Current price and 7-day change
   - Volume spike (% above average)
   - Recent chart pattern

4. **Why It Might Work** (Even for pump-and-dumps):
   - Could catch momentum before the dump
   - Legitimate underlying catalysts mixed with hype
   - Technical setup favorable for quick swing

5. **Why It's Risky**:
   - For organic plays: Overvaluation, weak fundamentals, regulatory issues
   - For pump-and-dumps: Specific red flags (coordinated posting times, bot accounts, suspicious volume, insider selling, known scam promoters)

6. **Disaster Scenario**:
   - For organic: "Hype fades with no catalyst, -40% in week"
   - For pumps: "Dump begins within 24-48 hours, -60-80% drop possible"

**PUMP-AND-DUMP SPECIFIC ANALYSIS:**
For Category B stocks, explicitly state:
- Estimated stage of pump (early accumulation, active pump, near dump, post-dump)
- Known promoter groups involved (if identifiable)
- Recommended approach: "Monitor only", "Quick scalp if experienced", "Avoid entirely"

**BOTTOM LINE:**
End with a clear summary: "Today's highest conviction organic play:", "Today's riskiest pump to avoid:", "Potential quick scalp opportunities (for experienced traders only):"

**FORMAT**: Tables for quick scanning, detailed breakdowns for each pick. Use warning emojis (🚨) for high-risk pump-and-dump stocks.
