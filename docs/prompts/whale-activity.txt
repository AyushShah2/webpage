**FIND:**
1. **Recent Insider Activity (Past 3 Days)**: Identify 5-10 stocks with significant insider PURCHASES and SALES by executives, directors, or 10%+ owners. Minimum transaction size: $100k.

2. **Institutional Moves (Past 3 Days)**: Identify major funds (Berkshire Hathaway, ARK, Tiger Global, Citadel, Bridgewater, etc.) that opened new positions or significantly increased/decreased existing holdings.

**FOR EACH STOCK PICK, PROVIDE:**

| Ticker | Current Price | Who's Trading | Trade Type (Buy/Sell) | Size | Date |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|------|------|

**DETAILED ANALYSIS FOR EACH:**
- **Why they're buying/selling**: What's the bull case? What catalysts exist (earnings, product launch, sector rotation, macro trends)?
- **Quantitative 30-day price projection**: Based on historical performance after similar insider/institutional activity, technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages), and current momentum - estimate potential price target in 30 days. Show your calculation methodology.
- **Background supporting the buy**: Company fundamentals, revenue growth, competitive position, recent news, sector tailwinds
- **Risk factors**: Why this could fail - debt levels, competition, regulatory risks, market conditions, valuation concerns, conflicting signals
- **Disaster scenarios**: Specific situations where this trade could "end terribly" (e.g., "If earnings miss by >10%", "If Fed raises rates unexpectedly", "If key customer contract lost")

**SECTOR PERFORMANCE**: In tabular format provide which sectors/industries have 
been performing the best-worst. The sectors can be general (ex: Technology) or 
specific (ex: Cloud Computing), but try to be as specific as possible. Provide 
performance for 1 day (previous day), 1 week, and 1 month.

**PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION SECTION:**
After presenting all picks, include this text:

"**PORTFOLIO REVIEW NEEDED**: Please share your current portfolio (tickers and position sizes). I will then:
- Identify which of today's opportunities best complement your existing holdings
- Flag any positions you should consider trimming based on recent insider selling
- Assess concentration risk and diversification gaps
- Suggest specific entry points and position sizing for new picks"

**IMMEDIATE ACTION ALERTS:**
- Flag any stocks from common portfolios with heavy insider selling in past 3 days
- Note any major institutional exits that could signal trouble
- Highlight urgent opportunities (e.g., insider buying before earnings, unusual whale accumulation)

**FORMAT**: Use tables for stock lists, bullet points for analysis. Make it scannable but comprehensive.
